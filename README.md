##  Linear Algebra - Computer Application - Signals and Systems
## Preamble
The purpose of the project is to develop firmware models for important transforms namely; Principal Component Analysis (PCA),  Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The students are expected to traverse journey from software to hardware through these projects. The aim for project is to also develop libraries of such firmware models which can be used in off the shelf mode to create projects of larger scope. The subsequent batches may improvise the hardware design and increase the size of library.

## Title of the projects

### Problem 1 – Principal Component Analysis:
The purpose of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set which consists of  large number of interrelated variables, while retaining as much  variation as possible in the data set.

### Problem 2 – Singular Value Decomposition:
It is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is also the generalization of the eigendecomposition to rectangular matrix. SVD is useful for pseudo inverse computation, low rank matrix approximation etc.

### Problem 3 – Linear Discriminant Analysis:
Like PCA it is a linear transformation technique that is used for dimensionality reduction. PCA can be described as an “unsupervised” algorithm, since it “ignores” class labels and its goal is to find the directions (the so-called principal components) that maximize the variance in a dataset. In contrast to PCA, LDA is “supervised” and computes the directions (“linear discriminants”) that will represent the axes that that maximize the separation between multiple classes.
